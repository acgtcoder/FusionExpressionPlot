Description: Plots exons from two genes as boxes scaled by exon size and
    colored based on expression in a sample. Fusion points between the two genes
    are represented as triangles at the appropriate position. This allows
    visualizing the drop in relative expression of the exons that are part of a
    putative expressed fusion transcript relative to the exons only in the
    unfused gene transcripts. Normalization is performed across an entire cohort
    of samples and then again within each gene, so color differences show exons
    whose expression is unusually variant within the genes against a background
    of similar samples.
